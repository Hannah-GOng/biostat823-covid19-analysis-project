## The objective of the Project & Target Audience
Build a dashboard showing the recent situation of covid-19, showing:
   - first page: the number of people taking vaccines by state and by brand; 
   - Second page: the estimated cases within next few weeks by state; 
   - third page: machine learning models predict whether a covid-19 positive patient will discharge or decease based on the clinical factors. 

The target audience of the dashboard is those who are interested in the covid-19 data. The audience can first have an overview of the distribution of vaccines from the first page, then they can see the estimated cases for each states in the second page and discover if there are some associations between the number of people vaccined and the number of cases.
Finally, they can go further to analyze that among the cases group, which factors may contribute more to determine their last status(discharge or decease)

## Data Set
The dataset we use come from the several sources:
