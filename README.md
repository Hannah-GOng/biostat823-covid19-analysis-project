## The objective of the Project
The objective of our project is to build a dashboard showing the recent progress of covid-19, include:
   - the number of people taking vaccines by state and by brand; 
   - the estimated deaths and cases within next few weeks; 
   - machine learning models predict whether a covid-19 positive patient will discharge or decease based on the clinical factors.
